# TODO

## v1.0

* Update `README.md`: "What if I remove an item from my wishlist without having added it to my collection?"
* Create `INSTALL.md` setup and config documentation based on getting Shelf set up on a DigitalOcean Droplet running CentOS.
* Create `favicon.ico` and `apple-touch-icon` logos
* Create Pinned Tab icon for Safari

## v1.1

* Improve socket communication with action codes (so there's not separate calls for Get, Add, Remove, Update, etc., just one unified call for data manipulations/retrievals).
* Light refactoring of controllers, server, and albumPoller (particularly with the page poller when iterating through records)

## v2.0

* Board games support with https://boardgamegeek.com
